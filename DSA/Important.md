### 1. Arrays & Strings (The Most Common)

These usually test your ability to manage memory and use pointers efficiently.

* **Two Sum:** Find two numbers that add up to a specific target.
* **Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock:** Find the maximum profit in a single transaction.
* **Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters:** Uses the **Sliding Window** pattern.
* **Merge Intervals:** How to handle overlapping ranges.
* **Trapping Rain Water:** A classic "Hard" problem using the **Two Pointers** or **Monotonic Stack** technique.

### 2. Linked Lists

Interviews here focus on pointer manipulation and "Fast & Slow" pointers.

* **Reverse a Linked List:** The absolute "Hello World" of linked list questions.
* **Detect Cycle in a Linked List:** Uses the "Tortoise and Hare" algorithm.
* **Merge Two Sorted Lists:** Similar to the merge step in Merge Sort.
* **LRU Cache (Least Recently Used):** A high-level system design problem using a Hash Map and Doubly Linked List.

---

### 3. Trees & Graphs

These focus on recursion and traversal (DFS vs. BFS).

* **Invert a Binary Tree:** Famous for being the question the creator of Homebrew couldn't answer at Google.
* **Validate Binary Search Tree:** Check if a tree follows BST rules.
* **Number of Islands:** A common **Graph DFS/BFS** problem to find connected components in a grid.
* **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA):** Finding the "deepest" shared parent of two nodes.

### 4. Dynamic Programming (The "Boss" Category)

DP is about breaking a problem into sub-problems and storing the results.

* **Climbing Stairs:** The simplest DP problem (essentially Fibonacci).
* **Coin Change:** Finding the minimum number of coins to make a total.
* **Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS):** A classic  or  problem.
* **House Robber:** Deciding which items to pick to maximize value without picking neighbors.

### Essential Interview Patterns to Learn

If you master these 5 patterns, you can solve about 80% of LeetCode problems:

| Pattern | Best Used For... | Example Problem |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Two Pointers** | Sorted arrays or linked lists | 3Sum, Palindrome check |
| **Sliding Window** | Subarrays, substrings, contiguous data | Longest Substring, Max Sum Subarray |
| **Fast & Slow Pointers** | Cycles or finding the middle of a list | Linked List Cycle, Middle of List |
| **DFS / BFS** | Trees, Graphs, Matrix traversal | Number of Islands, Path Finding |
| **Monotonic Stack** | "Next greater element" or "Next smaller" | Daily Temperatures, Histogram Area |
